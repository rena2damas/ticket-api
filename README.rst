A service for managing emails coming in/out from/to a O365 mailbox and integrates them with Jira.

This service is suitable for anyone looking to create Jira tickets from the emails arriving to a mailbox. The motivation behind the creation of this project is that, on one hand, Jira provides good tools to track and manage tickets, and O365 mailbox is a convenient way to receive requests in the form of an email. This solution comes to merge the best of both worlds by allowing one to create a Jira ticket directly from a O365 email. Once a new email arrives to a mailbox, the service picks up the message from the inbox folder, and contacts the Jira API for the creation of the ticket.

Setup ðŸ”§
=====
The application can run in several ways, depending on what the target platform is.
One can run it directly on the system with ``python`` or get it running on a
``kubernetes`` cluster.

Python
------
The project uses `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ for dependency management
. Therefore to set up the project (recommended):

.. code-block:: bash

    # ensure poetry is installed
    $ poetry env use python3
    $ poetry install

That will configure a virtual environment for the project and install the respective
dependencies, which is particular useful during development stage.

Kubernetes
----------
Refer to `README <.kustomization/README.rst>`_ under ``.kustomization/``.

Configuration ðŸ“„
-------------
Since the project can read properties from the environment, one can use an ``.env``
file for application configurations. These should be set accordingly for a correct
service usage.

A possible configuration is:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Database
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///example.db

    # Application context
    APPLICATION_CONTEXT=/api/tickets/v3

    # version of OpenAPI
    OPENAPI=3.0.3

    # The application providing info about the ticket
    TICKET_CLIENT_APP=https://example.com/

    # The mailbox to manage
    MAILBOX=mailbox@example.com

    # O365 registered tenant
    O365_TENANT_ID=...

    # O365 OAuth2 properties

    # O365 client id & secret for this application
    O365_CLIENT_ID=...
    O365_CLIENT_SECRET=...

    #   * 'offline_access': to be eligible to retrieve a refresh_token.
    #      Otherwise user only has access to resources for a single hour.
    #   * 'message_all': alias for 'mail.readwrite' + 'mail.send'
    #      for own user mailbox actions
    #   * 'message_all_shared': alias for 'mail.read.shared' + 'mail.readwrite.shared'
    #      for shared mailbox actions
    O365_SCOPES=offline_access,message_all,message_all_shared

    # Atlassian credentials
    ATLASSIAN_URL=https://atlassian.net
    ATLASSIAN_USER=me@example.com
    ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN=...

    # Jira settings
    JIRA_TICKET_TYPE=Task
    JIRA_TICKET_LABELS=ticket
    JIRA_TICKET_LABEL_CATEGORIES=general,bug
    JIRA_TICKET_LABEL_DEFAULT_CATEGORY=general

    # Jira supported boards
    JIRA_SUPPORT_BOARD=support
    JIRA_BOARDS=JIRA_SUPPORT_BOARD
    JIRA_DEFAULT_BOARD=JIRA_SUPPORT_BOARD

    # Filter settings
    EMAIL_WHITELISTED_DOMAINS=example.com
    EMAIL_BLACKLIST=malicious@example.com


O365 Auth
^^^^^^^^^
Because the service relies on ``O365`` services, one should start off by requesting permissions against the ``O365``
service:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ flask o365 authenticate
    > ... INFO in o365: Account not yet authenticated.
    > Visit the following url to give consent:
    > https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?response_type=code&...
    > Paste the authenticated url here:
    > ...

As seen above, the ``O365`` user must provide proper consent for this service to perform certain actions (see scopes)
on behalf of the user, as per defined in OAuth2 authorization flow. For the use case previously mentioned, the service
would require access to the ``O365`` user's inbox to read its content.

The best way to go about it is simply to open the link in a browser and accept the requested consents. The ``O365``
will redirect to a link containing the so desired authorization code. Simply paste that response link back to the
terminal, and it's done.

A new file ``o365_token.txt`` will be created which contains all the important OAuth2 parameters such as
the ``access_token`` and ``refresh_token``. The ``refresh_token`` has a duration of 90 days after which it
expires, so one must repeat the process just described to request new access codes.
